        <h2>An explicit list of features </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Single Agent Navigation: The agent moves at a constant velocity
            along its path from the start to goal position. I've also implemented
            motion smoothing as shown in the lecture by skipping nodes in 
            the path if possible</li>
            <li>Improved Agent and Scene Rendering: The theme is a plane 
            navigating throughout the clouds. the clouds are sprites
            that are used as the texture of a quad. an airplane sprite 
            is also used. Bounding circles are used as the hitbox</li>
            <li>Orientation Smoothing: the planes orientation matches its
            path. The motion is also smoothed.</li>
            <li>User Scenario Editing - obstacles can be added to the Scene
            at the mouse positionby pressing the A key on the keyboard.
            an obstacle can be moved around by hovering over it with the mouse
            and using the arrow keys. the agent position can be moved with
            right click and the goal position can be moved with left click</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>List of tools/libraries</h2>
        <p>Processing, based off the sample proj1 prm code. The a* implementation
        is based off Wikipedia pseudocode: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm#Pseudocode</p>
        <h2>difficulties encountered</h2>
        <p>Not many issues, I probably spent most of the time on the A*.</p>
